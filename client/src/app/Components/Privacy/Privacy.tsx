          <h6 className={styles.subtitle}>Your Choices and Controls</h6>
          <p className={styles.text}>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal data you provide to us, and the control you have over that personal data.</p>
          <ul className={styles.list}>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>Managing Digital Platform Entertainment, LLC Settings - If you register an account, you may manage the content and personal data you share when you use Digital Platform Entertainment, LLC through your account Settings, including for the features explained below. You are solely responsible for keeping your Settings up to date.</li>
            <ul className={styles.list}>
              <li className={styles.listItem}>Email & Device Notifications – You can adjust your Settings in the “Notification” tab to disable email and device notifications (other than important service updates and essential notifications about the Platform or your account). All commercial emails and newsletters also allow you to unsubscribe at any time.</li>
              <li className={styles.listItem}>Analytics – To control whether we collect analytics and usage information, including through cookies and similar technologies, you can adjust your Settings in the “Privacy” tab (“Cookie Manager”).</li>
              <li className={styles.listItem}>Marketing – If you do not want to receive personalized ads, offers or other marketing messages for Digital Platform Entertainment, LLC products or services, you can adjust your Settings in the “Privacy” tab (choose Communications in Your “Cookie Manager”).</li>
              <li className={styles.listItem}>Advertising – If you do not want Digital Platform Entertainment, LLC to deliver “interest based” or personalized ads for third party products, you can adjust your Settings in the “Advertising” tab. Please note, however, that even if you opt out of personalized ads, you may still see ads, but they will likely not be as relevant or useful to you.</li>
              <li className={styles.listItem}>Material Sharing – It’s not possible to make your account entirely private. However, you do have the option to make all your, playlists, and other uploads private. This means that no one will be able to access and listen to your Tracks without your explicit permission. You can learn more about these settings here.</li>
              <li className={styles.listItem}>Third Party Apps – If you have chosen to connect your account to a third-party application, like Facebook or Google, you can disable permission for the app by adjusting your Settings in the “Account” tab.</li>
              <li className={styles.listItem}>Third Party Developers – Digital Platform Entertainment, LLC has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some cool apps as an extension of the Platform. If you would prefer that your Tracks are not made available to third party app developers, you can disable API access within the sound page for each of the Tracks that you upload. Click on the pencil icon below the waveform player and navigate to the “Permissions” tab and uncheck the “enable app playback” box. Please note that your public profile information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that is not publicly available on the Platform.</li>
              <li className={styles.listItem}>Deleting Your Digital Platform Entertainment, LLC Account – If you have an account and would like to delete it, you may do so by adjusting your Settings in the account tab. If you delete your account, all personal data associated with your account (except for backup copies), including the Tracks that you have uploaded and the usage data associated with those Tracks, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. We therefore advise you to copy or backup all Materials uploaded to your account before deletion. Even if you delete your account, it is possible that your personal data may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search engines’ caching processes are outside of Digital Platform Entertainment, LLC’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any personal data that remains cached by search engines after that personal data has been removed from the Platform. Please note that deleting any Digital Platform Entertainment, LLC Apps, or any third-party apps to which your account is connected, will not delete your account. Similarly, if you delete a third-party app that is connected to your account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all personal data about your activity on the Platform from within that third party app. You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete personal data about your activity on the Platform from that third party app.</li>
              <li className={styles.listItem}>Messages From Other Users - If you do not want to receive messages from users you don’t follow, you can adjust your settings in the “Privacy” tab. If you want to block users, you will have to do so on their respective profiles. Any blocked user will be shown in your settings in the “Privacy” tab.</li>
            </ul>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>Managing Device Settings</li>
            <ul className={styles.list}>
              <li className={styles.listItem}>On your mobile device, disable the “Allow Apps to Request to Track” setting in your iOS phone’s settings, or enable the setting to “Opt out of Ads Personalization” in your Android phone’s settings. To opt-out of location tracking when using our Apps, you can use the settings of your device. You can disable mobile analytics and bug reporting through these same settings as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>Managing Browser Settings</li>
            <ul className={styles.list}>
              <li className={styles.listItem}>You may also control cookies in your browser settings. You can modify your settings in most web browsers to accept or deny cookies or to request your permission each time a site attempts to set a cookie.

          <ul className={styles.list}>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>Data Access and Portability - You may be entitled to request copies of your personal data held by us. While a lot of the personal data you provide to us can be accessed in your account settings, you may also be entitled to request copies of personal data you have provided to us in machine-readable format.</li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>Change or Correct Data - Where you cannot update personal data yourself through an account, you have the right to ask us to correct, change, update or rectify your personal data.</li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>Data Retention and Deletion - We generally retain personal data for as long as is necessary to provide services to you under your account, i.e. as long as your contract is ongoing and for the sake of legal obligations, for 3 years following the end of the year in which your contract was canceled - or, for as long as is necessary to provide the Platform to you as a unregistered user. You have the right to ask us to delete all or some of the personal data we hold about you. If you have an account, you can also delete your account through the settings at any time as described below. We may need to retain some of your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (e.g. under applicable tax or commercial law or to prevent fraud and abuse and maintain and enhance security). Afterwards, we delete the personal data immediately, unless we need the personal data until the expiry of the statutory period of limitation for the purpose of providing evidence for civil law claims or because of statutory storage obligations (e.g. for accounting reasons).</li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>Objection to Processing - You have the right to object to processing your personal data on grounds relating to your situation at any time (in particular, where we don’t have to process the personal data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests). If you object to such processing, Digital Platform Entertainment, LLC will no longer process your personal data for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing, or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or obligations. Where your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object to such processing of your personal data at any time and ask Digital Platform Entertainment, LLC to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes. However, please be aware that any objection to processing will not necessarily have an impact on the personal data processing before such objection was made, thus such processing will generally be deemed as permissible and will be subject to the usual retention and deletion periods.</li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>Restriction of Processing - You have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data where one of the following applies: your personal data is not accurate anymore; the processing is unlawful and instead of erasing the personal data you request the restriction of use; the personal data is no longer needed by us but required by you for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; you have objected to the use and the decision on the legitimate grounds for objection is pending.</li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>Withdrawing Consent - Where you provide consent to the processing of your personal data by Digital Platform Entertainment, LLC, you may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your account Settings or by sending a communication to Digital Platform Entertainment, LLC specifying the specific consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal.</li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>Lodging Complaints - You have the right to lodge complaints about the data processing activities carried out by Digital Platform Entertainment, LLC before a competent data protection authority.
